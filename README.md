Tic Tac Toe
===========

This is a very simple OpenGL Tic Tac Toe game program for playing two
humans against each other who are on the same client computer.
Although it currently is only programmed for Windows and only has
Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 project files, it can work just as well
on other platforms, it's just that I haven't copied over the relevant
build files, platform support files, etc. to do this.  See my other
OpenGL Rubik's Cube for the relevant code.
